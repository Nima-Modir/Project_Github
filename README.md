# Trustworthy AI - HW1 (Generalization and Robustness)
## Generalization:
**Objective**: Improve the generalization capabilities of a neural network model, specifically ResNet18.

**Task**: Train a ResNet18 model on the SVHN dataset and evaluate its generalization on the MNIST dataset. Various techniques such as architecture modifications, loss functions, data augmentation, and optimizers should be applied to improve the model’s generalization. The results are analyzed by comparing the performance across different datasets.
## Robustness:
**Objective**: Test the model's robustness against adversarial attacks.

**Task**: Use the CIFAR10 dataset and adversarial training methods (like FGSM and PGD) to improve the model’s resistance to adversarial examples. Evaluate and report the model's performance with and without adversarial training. Additionally, visualize the results using techniques like UMAP.
